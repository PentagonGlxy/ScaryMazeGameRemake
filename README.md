# The Maze (Python Remake) 🕹️

A faithful Python recreation of the classic "Scary Maze Game" (The Maze) from the golden era of Flash games.

> **⚠️ Transparency Note:**
> This project was created with the assistance of **Artificial Intelligence**.
>
> I am a beginner programmer currently on a journey to learn how to code from scratch. I used AI to help me generate the logic for this game to better understand how the `pygame` library works, how to handle game states, and how to structure collision detection. My goal is to use this project as a stepping stone to eventually build programs entirely on my own!

## 👻 About The Game

Do you have steady hands? This game challenges your precision and patience. Guide the tiny black pixel through 3 increasingly difficult levels without touching the walls.

This is a nostalgic trip back to the early 2000s internet culture, specifically designed to... *surprise* the new Gen Alpha gamers who never grew up with these classic pranks.

## ✨ Features

*   **Retro Aesthetics:** Replicates the classic Cyan paths and blocky geometry of the original.
*   **3 Levels:** Accurate recreations of the original level layouts, including the famous Level 3 "tight squeeze."
*   **Precision Gameplay:** Custom 5x5 pixel cursor hitbox.
*   **Classic Mechanics:** Hitting a wall teleports you back to the start of the level.
*   **The "Ending":** Includes the iconic surprise ending (Jumpscare implementation).

## 🛠️ Built With

*   [Python](https://www.python.org/)
*   [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) - For graphics and game logic.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Prerequisites
You need Python installed on your computer. You also need the `pygame` library.
pip install pygame
2. Assets Setup
Important: To make the game work on your machine, ensure you have the sound and image files properly linked in the code.
Create a folder named assets (or similar) in the same directory as the script.
Place your jumpscare image and sound file inside.
Update the file paths in the scary_maze_final.py script to match the location of your files.
3. Running the Game
Click the ScaryMaze application.

🎮 Controls
Mouse: Move the cursor through the maze.
Goal: Reach the Red Box to advance.
ESC: Quit the game (useful after the ending!).

⚠️ Warning
Volume Warning: This game contains loud noises and flashing images at the end. Play at your own risk (or use it to prank your friends).

Since I am a beginner, feel free to fork this repository and suggest improvements to the code! I am eager to learn better ways to write Python and organize game logic.
